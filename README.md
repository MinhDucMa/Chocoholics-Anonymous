# Chocoholics-Anonymous

This s a group project for cs300: Element Software Enginner course. Throughout the period, my group with 5 members will need to design annd build a software to help mamange the service provided by the ChocAn Organization, a company that provides health treatmentsv for those addicted to chocolate. 

The software will manage the data processing environmennt betweeen the members of ChocAn and various service providers. The software will be the membership database, which includes the registration process for new customers. It will aslo be responsible for logging visitations and services performed during the week, genenrating reports and totals for the monthly dues and services provided.

Each ChocAn member account will include the latest status of it and all the member information. This will help the service providers determine the membership status of any ChocAn account upon requesting a service.

The software will also manage the records of any service provided for a member. Those records can help in billing the members on their accounts and sending it as an email attachment and can be accessed by managers at any time. This means that personal information and health records should be well-secured and should not be published or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

The software will also build a database for service providers, including their personal information and the type of services they provide. It will also keep track of their weekly service records and total fees. At the end of every week, an electronic funds transfer report will be sent to their accounts containing the overall payment amount and their information for that payroll cycle.

# Milestones and Deliverables

This section will break down the project into different sections to provide the reader a clearer picture of each critical milestone of the project. Moreover, we will use this section to note down and address the significant objects, events, goals, and ideas relating to the project that our team considered. This section plays as a measurement of the progress of our project toward the final deliverable product. Milestones and Deliverables of this project will include four significant stages:

· Requirements Documents

· Design Documents

· Test Plan

· Project Report and Final Deliverables

## Requirements Document

Used to describe the intended use-case, functionality, non-functional requirements, and the challenges from the deliverable product's building journey. This document is also created to acquire every stakeholder's thoughts, aligning them regarding the software’s functionality. Furthermore, this step may be critical for measuring the final product's cost and comparing it with the available budget. A requirement document can also minimize the overall development time and cost from future inaccurate software development.

For this document, we will deliver four different components to clarify the ChocAn application's functionality to meet the needs of the stakeholders.

· Introduction

· Project Overview

· Functional Requirements

· Nonfunctional Requirements

1. Introduction

This section will summarize the principal focus of ChocAn application instruction and the materials that will be covered in the document. Moreover, the introduction section also describes the project itself, focusing on the entire project's big picture. Additionally, it will mention some of the smaller components such as project overview, functional requirements, and nonfunctional requirements that contribute to creating that big picture.

1.2 Product Overview

User, stakeholders, and use case will be our main focus in this section. Product Overview will describe shortly the functionality of the products based on the use case, needs of users, and stakeholders' requirements. Furthermore, this section also helps the developers address this application's target and use that as a notion for future adjustments. Stakeholders will also be mentioned in this section so that the developers can build the application based on the stakeholders' background. Finally, all possible use cases will be included as a general description of the application's functionality in real-life situations—all the details of how the application works' features will be described in this section.

1.3 Functional Requirements

This portion aims to describe the behavior and performance that the system, ChocAn, is supposed to have. The application's reaction and implementation reflected from the user's input will be discussed in detail within this section. Additionally, the functional requirements should also describe the system's behavior when facing certain predicted

special situations. This section is used to mention and explain the features of the ChocAn Health Service application.

1.4 Nonfunctional Requirement

For this portion of the requirement document, the discussion will be more toward usability of the ChocAn application's features and how well the system's performance when interacting with the user's input. Furthermore, this portion also predicts and measures the system's constraint in the matter of timing and development process. The readability, availability, or responsiveness of the system are some of the potential constraints discussed in this section.

2. Design Document

The design document is where all the information relating to the software's design concerns, the functionality of the included features, several constraints of the systems, and the system's organization will be mentioned. This document will serve as a guiding document for informing all the necessary considerations and concerns to the development team and other stakeholders. More specifically, we will provide the four significant elements to contribute to the build of the ChocAn Health Service Software including:

· Design Consideration

· System Overview

· System Architecture

· Detailed System Design

2.1 Design Consideration

In this section, all sources of constraints on building up the software will be mentioned thoughtfully. For instance, time constraints, funds limitation, or scope constraints will be some of this portion's primary focus. Furthermore, we will also consider dependencies as it timely related to the constraints of the project. In terms of dependencies, this section

will go over how tasks depend on each other as a matter of how the deadline of one task affects the other, the availability of task A to task B, etc.

2.2 System Overview

For this section, we will provide several different information regarding the system's goal, functionality, and architecture. Also, we will provide various diagrams and tables to address that vital information for having a better explanation and clearer understanding of how the system works when interacting with user's inputs. After going through the provided details, stakeholders and developers should understand the general working concept of the ChocAn system.

2.3 System Architecture

The description of top-level software components and their interactions is the main concentration in this portion of the design document. Moreover, this section also helps the stakeholders and developers identify these components, understand the purpose of the components, and how they perform in the running environment. Furthermore, diagrams such as interaction diagrams, UML diagrams, or data flow diagrams will be included to support and enhance the clarification of this portion.

2.4 Detailed System Design

In this section, we will dig deeper into the design of the system. We will discuss the operating environment that the system will run on. Also, the design and organization of the system and subsystems architecture will be discussed in detail. Also, we should consider the input formats from the user interface to determine the output layouts returned from the system.

3. Test Plan

Test plan plays an important role in this design document as it will give all stakeholders the needed information to determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the

software in terms of its performance, run time, cost of resources, and so on. For the test plan document of the ChocAn software, stakeholders will be able to go through the test strategy designed for the software, the objectives for a specific test, and the estimation of the test. Furthermore, this test plan should help the stakeholders have a better understanding of the deliverable of all the included test cases. Also, this test plan is documented so that it can be used as a reference for the future development of the ChocAn software. This test plan document will be broken down into four different stages to help the stakeholders and developers have a better and thoughtful aspect of this document. These four stages include:

· Test Plan Description

· Unit Testing

· Smoke Testing

· System Testing

3.1 Test Plan Description

We will mention the functionalities of the ChocAn software that need to be focused on, the types of bugs that customers may be interested in having a test, and the features that are supposed to be tested in this test plan description. Additionally, the schedule of each test will also be discussed to have better management of time used during the testing process. Following all the procedures mentioned above, we will also refer briefly to the information in the requirement document to serve as a comparison to the test results from this test plan to ensure satisfaction from stakeholders.

3.2 Unit Testing

Unit testing is one of the significant processes that need to be included in the test plans. As unit testing is the very first testing stage of the program, and usually has a very narrow and specific scope, these components testing can help to save cost and reduce the tediousness of searching and fixing program’s bugs. Also, unit testing helps to create reusability of code. We will have a well-defined strategy for testing several functions and class methods that were included in the ChocAn software.

3.3 Smoke Testing

In the stage of smoke testing, we will test out the functionality of the most critical functions work in the ChocAn software to accomplish a stable and trustable performance for the involvement of further testing processes. By including smoke testing, we can save test effort by detecting the showstoppers early in the build because our team will not need to waste time on further testing.

3.4 System Testing

As the final stage of the testing process, system testing will focus on validating the complete and fully integrated software product. This test will play as a big picture that is created from assembling other smaller pictures from previous testing stages before introducing the final product. We will test the interaction of the system when dealing with several different user’s inputs for desired outputs. Furthermore, in this testing stage, we will also go into detail about the performance of all the included functions in the user’s environment. Lastly, we will check and evaluate the compliance of the system with the specified requirement from the stakeholders.

4. Project Report and Final Deliverable

This stage will be conducted on February 22, 2021 to serve as a finalized process for this project. Stakeholders of the ChocAn Health Service Software will take this stage as an opportunity for recapping all the process that has gone through in order to produce the final software product. In addition, this stage will also play the role of transferring ownership and finishing the contract between stakeholders.

4.1 Presentation

The presentation will give us the chance to introduce our final software product to the class. We will be able to summarize the features, performance, or general achievements of the application. Furthermore, in this section, we will recap all the required stages to complete the final project. We would also state the initial goal of the project mentioned in the requirements document so that we will know what we have or haven't accomplished

in this final product. The presentation will also allow us to share what we have learned during the building process for the application.

4.2 Presentation slides

Our group will include several slides to help the stakeholders have a clear visual to the approach of our software product. These slides can also serve as a summarizing of the project main’s materials such as features, target of the products, general scenarios of the outputs from user’s input, or general user’s cases. Furthermore, these slides also summarize the number of test cases that had been conducted during and after the build of ChocAn Health Service Software. Stakeholders of ChocAn Software will receive a copy of these slides to serve as a reference for future software enhancement or testing procedure.

4.3 Demonstration

We will introduce and run the actual functionality and performance of the application in this stage. Our team will prove the ChocAn software's performance by inserting several different user’s inputs in different scenarios. This demonstration should be sufficient to show the other stakeholders or classmates the software's well-functioning in different test cases.

4.4 Final Version

In these final stages, after having a closer look at the ChocAn software through presentation and demonstration, the stakeholders will be able to run an acceptance test to determine the final product's compatibility with the initial requirements specifications and ensure the satisfaction of the customer with the product. Once the acceptance test has been completed with a high compatible level to the requirements, our team will go over the process of transferring legal rights and ownership of the software to the contractor, Chocoholics Anonymous.
